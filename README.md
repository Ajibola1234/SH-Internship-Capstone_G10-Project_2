    2. Use bootstrap or any other framework to make the form section responsive.

    3. For the navigation bar section, no framework including bootstrap should be used. Use your custom CSS styling to make it responsive.

    4. All input fields in the form section must be validated with vanilla javascript only, no validation library must be used.

    5. The input field for the password must have an eye icon so that when it's clicked, the user can hide or show the password.

    7. Happy coding!
